# Project Overview
## What I learned
This project explores a single page layout with animations and clickable links. This is my second time building a website with HTML/CSS. I learned how to problem solve my own problems and familiarized myself with html and css. I'm happy to say that I am confident in my coding abilities even though I use the help of AI and begin with starter code.
## Problem Solving and Accessability
This single page business card website solves the problem of having to find contact information and portfolios across different sites/apps. etc. I addressed accessability by adding alt text tags and running colors through Adobe Color. I focused on simplicity as well as color contrast to make it easy to find information. I had to slow the animation and change the colors to make it less overwhelming.
## Styling
The breathing gradient animation makes this site stand out dispite it's minimalistic qualities. I used Montserrat as my font because it is simple and geometric which creates the modern and bold look I wanted. I used mostly black for a clean look but added dark green for a natural grungy feel. I created my svg vectors in Adobe Illustrator and my wireframes and mockups were in Figma.
